A weapon(s) that acts kind of like a stunning strike, which prevents a Drifter from switching to a different drone.

Something similar for the reverse: a weapon that blocks Drifters from taking control of a specific drone. Only those Drifters that were already inside it when the weapon went off can pilot it.
