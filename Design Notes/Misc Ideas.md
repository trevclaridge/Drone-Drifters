# Misc Ideas

A weapon(s) that acts kind of like a stunning strike, which prevents a Drifter from switching to a different drone.

Something similar for the reverse: a weapon that blocks Drifters from taking control of a specific drone. Only those Drifters that were already inside it when the weapon went off can pilot it.

---

Instead of making it so Drifters can only activate an un-activated drone each round, allow them activate any drone, but have certain abilities can only be used once per "refresh," which is when every drone has been activated at least once.

- Add a checkbox to the fleet sheet for "Activated"

---

Drones of Size bigger than 1 take up as many hexes as their size value for the sake of silhouette and targetability. You just designate one hex of the footprint to be the front, which is what is used for moving and maneuvering.

---

Drift Ricochet. When a Drifter transfers to a new drone, they bounce any existing Drifters in that drone to a different drone. This replaces choosing where to move at the beginning of a turn, you instead activate the drone your currently piloting, then choose to shift to a new drone at the end of your turn.

- abilities based on Ricochet
    - when you choose to Ricochet...
    - chain of Ricochets

Pilot Roles (classes)

- Ace (shooting)
- Bouncer (Drift Ricochet)
- Engineer (Repair and Salvage)
- Tactician (buffs and additional activations)
- Hacker/Saboteur (debuff enemies)
- Cleaner (remove dice from systems)

---

There should be one or a few sports outlined in the book that Drifters can play in their downtime. Maybe it's a full on minigame.

---

Whenever a Drifter activates a weapons system, they may choose to take any amount of Mental damage (damage directly to the Drifter); the amount of Mental damage taken can be added to the weapon's damage against its target

---

Drifters gain Scars when they fall below specific thresholds in Health

---

Every combat has a countdown (or a numbering system to keep track of the current round). To emphasize the danger of using Drift technology, Drifters take damage as the combat goes on longer and longer.

---

When a drone takes damage with any active pilots, the damage is taken a system at random. Each system (including the Hull) is given a number and the most suitable die for the number of systems is rolled to determine the hit target. 

- A Star that allows a Drifter to allocate damage for the last drone they piloted in addition to the one they are currently pilotting.
- What happens to overflow damage? 
    - It is lost and doesn't affect any further systems. Possibly this is a special passive trait to buy for a drone.
    - It is applied to the Hull.
    - It is divided amongst remaining systems.
- If the drone has an odd number of systems, the die used will have at least one number that doesn't match a system. This could just be a reroll until a proper result is given, or the attack could miss, which could be a tactical consideration.
