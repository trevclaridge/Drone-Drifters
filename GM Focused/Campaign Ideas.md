# Campaign

## Intro

Start with a great pilgrimage. All humans in the galaxy return to Earth for a holiday that only happens once every 100 years. It is meant to remind humanity of its modest beginnings, as well as a lesson against inter-human conflict, as Earth is...

- a barren waste land, destroyed by humanity in their ceaseless wars. The remaining humans are descendants of those that escaped Earth during man's greatest and last war.
- a green paradise. Humanity uses Earth as a sort of monument and on-going project, returning her to nature through utopian collaboration. With human conflicts ceased, Earth is able to heal herself, marking her as a symbol of the futility of war.
- A mix of the above two options. One half of Earth is restored to her former idyllic glory through great effort, while the other half is left alone, barring her deep and unhealing scars of humanity's violent past. The symbol is the same, shown this time in clear visual contrast.

While humanity is gathered, remembering their history and celebrating their achievements, Earth is destroyed before their collective eyes. Chaos follows.

- Humanity splinters and flees into the galaxy, all thoughts of unity lost to the embers.
- They flee back to their home worlds and stations, hoping to protect them from any additional destruction. (This should be the players first priority.)
- Alien nations are involuntarily involved as blame is thrown and old grudges are brought back for interstellar witch-hunting.
- Rumors of war brew, while motives and perpetrator remain unclear.
- Signs of a greater threat.

## Threads

- Set up that humanity is the only known species capable of accessing the Drift. While plenty of other alien races use remote drones for various tasks, the technology that humans use to drift their consciousnesses between attack drones is uniquely theirs.
	- When the alien nation that destroyed Earth is revealed, they claim they were just reacting to human aggression and defending themselves. They talk about their society being attacked by users of Drift technology, which points them towards humanity. They are mistaken, the truth is that a new alien threat is emerging that is also capable of Drifting.
		- Allows for the enemies of this new threat to use weapons that directly target Drifted consciousness inside of the player's drones.
		- Perhaps this alien space exists entirely in the Drift, with no physical form.
- Season 0/1 could have each player go through some kind of procedure that tests whether a human is capable of handling Drift. Can be a sort of weird psychedelic thing like the Voight-Kampff test from Blade Runner.
	- Flashbacks to these tests to introduce the characters.
	- "Why are we training on this ancient shit anyway? Not like we're ever gonna use it."
		- Another cadet says this in a locker room or something, and each player hears it. After each character's test flashbacks, ask the player how they react to hearing this.

---

Race of ancient megalithic aliens that are locked away in a sort of status. The government is keenly aware of their existence and striving to keep them from entering back into humanity's regions of space.

---

Long Range Drift (LRD), an experimental extension of standard Drift that allows remote piloting at huge ranges. Consciousnesses are pinged through a serious of Drift Beacons placed throughout the galaxy.

---

An alien character that is just one drone from a massive hive mind, located a large distance away.

---

A countdown, discovered on an otherwise unimpressive world. A countdown to what? No one knows.

---

When meeting the other race of Drift-capable aliens

- Put another player token on the board, representing the alien consciousness.
- The alien has the ability to take over the drones from the human fleet.

---

Group of Drifted consciousnesses trapped in some sort of inanimate object, like a stranded drone that has no power.

- The whole crew of a large spaceship Drifted their consciousnesses to save themselves as their ship was about to be destroyed.
- When the Drift piloting station is destroyed, Drifted consciousnesses are stuck wherever they reside until they can launch to another open Drift connection.

---

An entire solar system that has been consumed by a parasitic alien race. Tendrils spanning outer space, connecting planets together.

---

Rogue AI that is in the process of turning a region of space into some mundane object, like the example of the stamp collecting AI.

- Another AI that was tasked with terraforming planets, has just been creating a multitude of lush paradises in a remote sector.

---

AI that hides on a character's computer until they feel they can trust the character not to report them/delete them. Purely interact with the player through text.

---

A malevolent intelligent entity is stranded in space, just waiting for someone to come along so they can kill them and steal their mode of transport back to civilization.

- first fine a benevolent being; this person seems harmless and doesn't know how they ended up stranded. Convince the players that this person is safe and be less afraid of picking up another stranded person.
- when they find the malevolent, it also starts out fine; it's only when the two are together that something is unlocked in the first that causes them to be evil.

---

An alien brings back to life a body that was previously sent out into space as part of a funeral procession.

---

A collective of megalithic alien species. The Older Lights.

- Each member is of a different species, each seemingly singular (of no known species, last of their people kind of thing, but it's not definite that they are the last)
- They've joined together to hold each other accountable--they do not want their more primal natures to overcome them. Should they lose control, they could destroy entire nations of the "younger lights" with ease.
- They are a wise and mentoring collective, providing insight where asked, but not interfering for fear of influencing younger species away from developing naturally.
- The GM could be called the Oldest Light. Sort of a fusing of the setting with the role of the meta role of the GM shaping the entire universe.

---

There should be multiple alliances between alien species. Kind of like the Council races from Mass Effect, but there would be multiple Councils.

---

A species/nation that is are the willing servants/helpers/assistants of another species or nation. They are trying to atone for some incredibly harsh wrongdoing from the past. Neither speak very openly about what that atrocity was, so as not to give other peoples the idea

---

Alien race of benevolent microscopic organisms. This race reanimates dead bodies to move and speak. People are generally wary of them due purely to their reanimation of the dead, but they are generally good-natured and aware that their way of being is contrary to most others. Some agree to only animate bodies that have volunteered their body for the purpose of allowing this race a host.

- When this species reanimates a body, they actually gain access to some or all of the host's memories. They keep this a secret from other races because they don't want this ability to be exploited for things like espionage. They also worry about their own individuality; when they gain memories, they also gain the host's emotional connections to those memories. This can result in the parasite developing emotional feelings concerning the host's former social circle--love for old relationships, malice for enemies, etc. The parasite actively needs to push these feelings down in order to feel like a separate individual from their host body.
- A planet is overrun by a feral form of this parasite species. The sapient form protects this feral form from outsiders. Kind of like how humanity keeps away from primitive tribes.

---

A sentient star or planet.

---

Every sentient race of alien should have a secret or a number of secrets, in the same vein as the parasite secret above. I like mysteries, and each race having a secret helps facilitate that.

---

Start session 1 with a Drift Compatibility test for each of the Drifters.

- Each Drifter gets their own little scene where they are asked questions and have their mentality acuity tested and their fortitude strained.
- Have the first Drifter's test go very different to the others, leaving the players to wonder why that specific Drifter was treated so differently. The reality can be a number of things, including:
    - That Drifter is being experimented on.
    - That Drifter is really an android and they don't know it; humanity is attempting to test Drift technology on AI consciousnesses.
    - something from that Drifter'e backstory
- The GM should never directly acknowledge the differences in the test. When asked, they can just say something along the lines of: "I don't know what you're talking about."

Charley had a great idea for what the test might look like: basically it is just the candidate Drifts to an object and must observe their own inanimate/catatonic body. For some reason, only certain humans can handle this sight of themselves, so that is used to measure true Drift Compatibility.

Some additional cool ideas I had inspired by this:

- The test could be named after a famous Drift pilot that came up with it. This could be Nova as a nod to Charley and her characters (Nova in D:BL and Overclocked both develop human-machine consciousness transfer technology.
- There could be like a strict training regime before this final test, in an effort to protect those who might not be able to pass, as failing the test means severe permanent mental damage. Those who try the test are doing it at great risk to themselves.
- The test could also just be an endurance test for potential Drifters in that it forces them to pilot an object that is entirely incapable of moving. They feels incredibly claustrophobic and agency-killing to the Drifters--it is important to know whether they will be able to handle that kind of stress, especially as they may be piloting a drone when the drone is destroyed or loses power, effectively trapping them in a similar situation to that of the test.

---

The Drift technology is a neural implant that must be surgically installed to the Drifters' brain stems. When a Drifter pilot enters the Drift, their body goes limp as they befall catatonia and slip into unconsciousness.

A few reasons I find this interesting:

- It allows the Drifters to enter combat immediately when the fleet is in danger.
- It can provide some drama as to where the Drifter is when the call comes and they must enter the Drift. They will fall unconscious in precarious or embarrassing situations.
- Narrative possibilities for forcing a Drifter into the Drift.
	- Important to remember not to take away a player's agency. This should really only be used to "show" the Drifter something, like a vision, or the ability to pilot a foreign drift-capable machine.

---

A protomolecule-esque alien/technology that diligently builds insane technologies for humanity. No one understands why this entity seems to perform this action specifically for humans; humanity had no hand it creating this entity, nor does this entity communicate in any way, so no one has any information on its origins or even its current projects. Humanity does not direct the entity--no one ever knows what it is going to build next, or even what it is building while in the midst of construction. The entity simply builds and builds, then moved on to the next project.

Whenever the entity finishes a work, that work jumps humanity forward in technology by a not-insignificant degree. Humanity has taken to rely on this entity for technological advancement. While it constructs it's projects, humans station guards around the build sites to protect the entity, while scientists and researchers study the entity and its progress to try to understand and predict the current project's function.

---

When Earth is destroyed, humanity is invited by a sympathetic alien race to settle a planet in their home system. Their former home planet was also destroyed in ages past and they feel a kinship to humanity fue to their similar histories. This race can be a incredible ally to humanity should humanity have the wisdom to trust them.

---

A malevolent entity regards humanity or some allied alien species the same way real life humans regard cockroaches: disdain and annoyance. Try as one might to eliminate all cockroaches you see, you will never completely eradicate all of them from the world.

Humanity (or an alien ally) has been routinely and systematically destroyed by this entity throughout the centuries of the universe, but we have the incredibly infuriating habit of surviving that destruction and recomposing our civilization, likely without the memories of our troubled history.

The entity notices our presence and comes to destroy us once more, this time hoping to truly finish us off.

---

The entire universe is a simulation inside the Oldest Light's cosmic mind. 

- It's implied that the Older Lights are aware of this, but that they keep this information to themselves.
- Have The Between-esque cutaways where players can describe little slice-of-life moments going on in the universe far away from the player characters. Maybe it awards a Cohesion or something. Allows the players to do some creating in the infinity of space, without outright giving them control over the setting of the campaign.
