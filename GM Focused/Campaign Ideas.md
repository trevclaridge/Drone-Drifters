# Campaign

## Intro

Start with a great pilgrimage. All humans in the galaxy return to Earth for a holiday that only happens once every 100 years. It is meant to remind humanity of its modest beginnings, as well as a lesson against inter-human conflict, as Earth is...

- a barren waste land, destroyed by humanity in their ceaseless wars. The remaining humans are descendants of those that escaped Earth during man's greatest and last war.
- a green paradise. Humanity uses Earth as a sort of monument and on-going project, returning her to nature through utopian collaboration. With human conflicts ceased, Earth is able to heal herself, marking her as a symbol of the futility of war.
- A mix of the above two options. One half of Earth is restored to her former idyllic glory through great effort, while the other half is left alone, barring her deep and unhealing scars of humanity's violent past. The symbol is the same, shown this time in clear visual contrast.

While humanity is gathered, remembering their history and celebrating their achievements, Earth is destroyed before their collective eyes. Chaos follows.

- Humanity splinters and flees into the galaxy, all thoughts of unity lost to the embers.
- They flee back to their home worlds and stations, hoping to protect them from any additional destruction. (This should be the players first priority.)
- Alien nations are involuntarily involved as blame is thrown and old grudges are brought back for interstellar witch-hunting.
- Rumors of war brew, while motives and perpetrator remain unclear.
- Signs of a greater threat.

## Threads

- Set up that humanity is the only known species capable of accessing the Drift. While plenty of other alien races use remote drones for various tasks, the technology that humans use to drift their consciousnesses between attack drones is uniquely theirs.
	- When the alien nation that destroyed Earth is revealed, they claim they were just reacting to human aggression and defending themselves. They talk about their society being attacked by users of Drift technology, which points them towards humanity. They are mistaken, the truth is that a new alien threat is emerging that is also capable of Drifting.
		- Allows for the enemies of this new threat to use weapons that directly target Drifted consciousness inside of the player's drones.
		- Perhaps this alien space exists entirely in the Drift, with no physical form.
- Season 0/1 could have each player go through some kind of procedure that tests whether a human is capable of handling Drift. Can be a sort of weird psychedelic thing like the Voight-Kampff test from Blade Runner.
	- Flashbacks to these tests to introduce the characters.
	- "Why are we training on this ancient shit anyway? Not like we're ever gonna use it."
		- Another cadet says this in a locker room or something, and each player hears it. After each character's test flashbacks, ask the player how they react to hearing this.

Race of ancient megalithic aliens that are locked away in a sort of status. The government is keenly aware of their existence and striving to keep them from entering back into humanity's regions of space.

Long Range Drift (LRD), an experimental extension of standard Drift that allows remote piloting at huge ranges. Consciousnesses are pinged through a serious of Drift Beacons placed throughout the galaxy.
