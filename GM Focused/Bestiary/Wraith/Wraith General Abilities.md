# Wraith General Abilities

## Wink

When a Wraith ship is damaged, it winks out of existence and becomes invisible. Until the combatant next makes an attack, its position is hidden. A Drifter piloting a Survey drone may attempt a Test on their turn to detect the vanished Wraith and reveal its current location, provided the Wraith is within range of the Survey drone's survey system. Regardless of the Test's result, the Oldest Light reveals how many invisible Wraiths were within range.
