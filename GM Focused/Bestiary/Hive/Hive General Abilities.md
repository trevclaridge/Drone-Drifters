# Hive General Abilities

## Organic Flak

When this creature's Armor score completely absorbs all incoming Ballistic damage from an attack, the attacker must make a reaction roll of a d6. On a roll of 1-3, the attacker takes one rank of **Hive Infection**. The effects of Hive Infection ranks are described below:

| Rank | Effect                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | -5 to Speed                                       |
| 2    | -10 to Speed                                      |
| 3    | Armor reduced to 0                                |
| 4    | Side weapons become inoperable                    |
| 5    | Shields reduced to 0                              |
| 6    | 1d6 damage to self at the beginning of each round |
| 7    | Hive takes control of the infected drone          |

Hive Infection can be treated in the following ways:

- 1 rank of Hive Infection is removed for each Repair action from a Tender drone
- 1 rank of Hive Infection is removed when the drone takes 5 points of Energy damage in a single attack that are not absorbed by Shields
- 1 rank of Hive Infection is removed for each downtime action used to Repair the drone (effects of Repair apply as normal)
