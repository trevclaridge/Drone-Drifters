# Drone Statistics

The drones that the players will use in space combat are defined with the following statistics:

1. **Class** - what type it is
2. **Size** - how big it is
3. **Hull** - it's health
4. **Speed** - how far it can move or turn in a single activation
5. **Armor** - how resistant it is to ballisitc weapons
6. **Shields** - how resistant it is to energy weapons

## Class

Some time ago, the bureaucrats decided that every ship and drone manufactured by humans for humans needed to have an identifying Class in order to make reporting easier. We hate to admit it, but they actually happened to be right this one time. Identifying a drone's Class quickly gives a general idea of its capabilities and structures. Small improvement modifications (or damage scars) will make every drone unique, but the gist will remain the same between drones of the same Class.

## Size

Something something, broad side of a barn. Anyways, it's a lot easier to hit a big ship than a tiny one. A drone's Size is what tells you how big its physical silhouette is in the context of a space battle. Many individual mechanics, like weapon systems or sensors, will behave differently when targeting ships of different sizes.

## Hull

One too many bullet holes will put your drone out of commission indefinitely. In order for your drone to live and fight another day, you need to maintain Hull integrity. When attacks from enemies overcome your Armor or Shields, the drone's systems take damage, potentially disabling them. If all of a drone's systems are disabled, hits will instead inflict damage on the drone itself, draining its Hull. When a drone's Hull reaches zero, the drone is destroyed.

## Speed

Drifters glide on the thought plane, but drones need to burn hard in the real. Speed is a drone's tool for that burn, acting as their main movement stat. During an activation, a drone can move up to its Speed in hexes. Certain abilities or traits may add to or subtract from a drone's Speed, allowing further or shorter movement.

Drones can only move in the forward direction, however, meaning they needs some mechanism for turning. Speed also governs a drone's ability to turn in space, referred to as **Maneuvering**. Instead of using a point of Speed to move forward, a drone can instead using the point in a *maneuver* to rotate one hex face in either direction from its current forward hex face. After the maneuver is completed, the drone will have a new forward hex face, and can move forward with an additional point of Speed as normal, or it can proceed to maneuver to rotate a greater arc. A "maneuver 6" would represent a full 360° rotation (necessary for some special abilities).

Speed indicates the total combined movements and maneuvers a drone can perform (in any order) during an activation.

## Armor

The pit crew's biggest nightmare. They will yell at you every time you bring home a drone with even just the tiniest scratch—you'll learn to tune it out pretty quickly. A drone's Armor is its lifeblood against weaponry that uses base physical force to inflict damage. Weapons like missiles, turrets, and explosive mines will need to overcome a drone's Armor in order to cause any amount of carnage. When a drone or an enemy ship rolls to deal **Ballistic** damage, it must exceed its target's Armor stat in order to deal damage--the target's Armor value is subtracted from the rolled damage value, with any remainder being applied as damage the drone. Any special abilities from the attack are applied regardless of whether the target drone took any damage.

## Shields

Basically what keeps the quantum entrails of your drone (and thereby you brain) from boiling to those pesky light weapons. Not "light" as in "not heavy," "light" as in "literally made of frakkin' light." Like Armor, Shields protect a drone against attack, this time safeguarding it from energy weapons, like arc cannons, hard-light burn beams, and EMP emitters. When a drone or an enemy ship rolls to deal **Energy** damage, it must exceed its target's Shields stat to deal damage. The target's Shields value gets subtracted from the rolled damage value, and any remainder gets applied as damage to the drone. Any special abilities from the attack are applied regardless of whether the target drone took any damage.
