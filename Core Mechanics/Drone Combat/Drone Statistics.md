# Drone Statistics

The drones that the players will use in space combat are defined with the following statistics:

1. **Class** - what type it is
2. **Size** - how big it is
3. **Speed** - how far it can move in a single activation (measured in number of hexes)
4. **Armor** - how resistant it is to ballisitc weapons
5. **Shields** - how resistant it is to energy weapons
6. **Maneuverability** - how far it can pivot in a single activation (measured in number of hex faces)

## Class

Some time ago, the bureaucrats decided that every ship and drone manufactured by humans for humans needed to have an identifying Class in order to make reporting easier. We hate to admit it, but they actually happened to be right this one time. Identifying a drone's Class quickly gives a general idea of its capabilities and structures. Small improvement modifications (or damage scars) will make every drone unique, but the gist will remain the same between drones of the same Class.

## Size

Something something, broad side of a barn. Anyways, it's a lot easier to hit a big ship than a tiny one. A drone's Size is what tells you how big its physical silhouette is in the context of a space battle. Many individual mechanics, like weapon systems or sensors, will behave differently when targeting ships of different sizes.

## Speed

Drifters glide on the thought plane, but drones need to burn hard in the real. Speed is a drone's tool for that burn, acting as their main movement stat. During an activation, a drone can move up to its Speed in hexes in any direction. Certain abilities or traits may add to or subtract from that number.

## Armor

The pit crew's biggest nightmare. They will yell at you every time you bring home a drone with even just the tiniest scratch—you'll learn to tune it out pretty quickly. A drone's Armor is its lifeblood against weaponry that uses base physical force to inflict damage. Weapons like missiles, turrets, and explosive mines will need to overcome a drone's Armor in order to cause any amount of carnage. When a drone or an enemy ship rolls to deal **Ballistic** damage, it must meet or exceed its target's Armor stat in order to hit--if the rolled value is equal to or greater than the target's Armor, the hit lands and the weapon's damage and special abilities are applied to the target.

## Shields

Basically what keeps the quantum entrails of your drone (and thereby you brain) from boiling to those pesky light weapons. Not "light" as in "not heavy," "light" as in "literally made of frakkin' light." Like Armor, Shields protect a drone against attack, this time safeguarding it from energy weapons, like arc cannons, hard-light burn beams, and EMP emitters. When a drone or an enemy ship rolls to deal **Energy** damage, it must meet or exceed its target's Shields stat to hit. On a hit, the energy damage and any special properties of the weapons are applied to the target.

## Maneuverability

Not to be confused with Speed's harsh combustion-based hurry, Maneuverability represents a drone's dexterity in turning itself in the directions it needs to go. Used in conjunction with Speed, Maneuverability is used to ensure a drone's weaponry is lined up with an enemy in order to shoot it down. A small Cruiser class drone will have an easier time countering its own inertia in order to make a sharp turn; a massive Destroyer, on the other hand, may take several agonizing minutes to make a full rotation.

A drone's Maneuverability indicates the number of hex faces it can rotate during its movement phase. The minimum would be 2, as it turns to either of the adjacent faces of the face it is currently directed; maximum would be 6, which would represent a full 360° rotation back to the beginning face (necessary for some special abilities). Examples for how this works in practice will come a little later in the Combat Examples section.
