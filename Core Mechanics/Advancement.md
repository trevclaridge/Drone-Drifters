# Advancement

After every combat encounter, the GM will award each player a number of Advancements, usually equal to the sum of the Size values of all destroyed enemy combatants.

These Advancements can be used to:

- gain new Stars
- remove Scars
- gain ranks of a Career
- build new systems for drones
- decrease a drone's system's Drift Dice cost
- build a new drone
- increase the Hull value of a drone or one of its systems
- increase a Drifter's Stamina
- gain Cohesion
- get increased benefits from a downtime action

Advancements can be traded or gifted between Drifters at any time.

The GM may choose to award additional Advancements for whatever reasons they wish.

**Stars:** Each Star will list its own Advancement cost. Whenever a new Star is gained, the Drifter who takes it must also take on a new Scar.

**Scars:** The Advancement costs listed on a Scar represent the cost to *remove* the Scar.

**Careers:** Each new rank of a Career requires spending an equal number of Advancements points, i.e. Rank 1 is 1 Advancement, Rank 2 is 2 Advancements and so on. Ranks must be acquired in order; Drifters cannot skip to ranks higher than 1 without spending the Advancements for all prior ranks. For example, a Drifter who would like to pick up Rank 4 in Entertainer must spend 10 Advancements (Ranks 1 + 2 + 3 + 4).

**Systems:** Each system will list its own Advancement cost. Systems can be built even if no drones can currently accommodate their installation. Downtime actions can be used to swap and reconfigure a drones' systems.

**System Cost**: 5 Advancements can be spent to reduce a system's Drift Dice cost by 1. System costs cannot be reduced below 1.

**Drones:** New drones can be built from scratch. Allocating Advancements to a new drone represents adding a drone to the fleet; this drone will have all the base statistics for its class and no installed systems. Each drone class lists the Advancements necessary to build it.

**Hull:** Advancements can be spent to reinforce the Hull value of a drone or its systems with a ratio of 4 Advancements to 1 Hull. A drone's main Hull cannot exceed 12 and systems cannot exceed 10 Hull.

**Stamina:** Similar to Hull, a Drifter's Stamina can be increased with Advancements at a ratio of 4 Advancements to 1 Stamina.

**Cohesion:** Advancements can be traded for Cohesion at a ratio of 1 Advancement to 1 Cohesion.

**Downtime:** Some downtime actions will describe ways in which Advancements can be used to gain greater benefits than its base reward. Those downtime actions will list the Advancement costs and their effects.
