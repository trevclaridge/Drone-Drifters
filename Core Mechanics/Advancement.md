# Advancement

After every combat encounter, the GM will award each player a number of Advancements, usually equal to the sum of the Size values of all destroyed enemy combatants.

These Advancements can be used to:

- gain new Stars
- remove Scars
- gain ranks of a Career
- build new systems for drones
- build a new drone
- increase the Hull value of a drone or one of its systems
- increase a Drifter's Stamina
- decrease a drone's system's Drift Dice cost
- gain Cohesion
- get increased benefits from a downtime action

Advancements can be traded or gifted between Drifters at any time.

The GM may choose to award additional Advancements for whatever reasons they wish.
