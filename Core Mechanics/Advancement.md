# Advancement

After every combat encounter, the GM will award each player a number of Credits, usually equal to the sum of the Size values of all destroyed enemy combatants.

These Credits can be used to:

- gain new Stars
- remove Scars
- gain ranks of a Career
- build new systems for drones
- decrease a drone's system's Drift Dice cost
- build a new drone
- increase the Hull value of a drone or one of its systems
- increase a Drifter's Stamina
- gain Cohesion
- get increased benefits from a downtime action

Credits can be traded or gifted between Drifters at any time.

The GM may choose to award additional Credits for whatever reasons they wish.

**Stars:** Each Star will list its own Advancement cost. Whenever a new Star is gained, the Drifter who takes it must also take on a new Scar.

**Scars:** The Credits costs listed on a Scar represent the cost to *remove* the Scar.

**Careers:** Each new rank of a Career requires spending an equal number of Credit s, i.e. Rank 1 is 1 Credit, Rank 2 is 2 Credits and so on. Ranks must be acquired in order; Drifters cannot skip to ranks higher than 1 without spending the Credits for all prior ranks. For example, a Drifter who would like to pick up Rank 4 in Entertainer must spend 10 Credits (Ranks 1 + 2 + 3 + 4).

**Systems:** Each system will list its own Credit cost. Systems can be built even if no drones can currently accommodate their installation. Downtime actions can be used to swap and reconfigure a drones' systems.

**System Cost**: 5 Credits can be spent to reduce a system's Drift Dice cost by 1. Each system will identify its unique cost floor, a value that its cost cannot be lowered below.

**Drones:** New drones can be built from scratch. Allocating Credits to a new drone represents adding a drone to the fleet; this drone will have all the base statistics for its class and no installed systems. Each drone class lists the Credits necessary to build it.

**Hull:** Credits can be spent to reinforce the Hull value of a drone or its systems with a ratio of 4 Credits to 1 Hull. A drone's main Hull cannot exceed 12 and systems cannot exceed 10 Hull.

**Stamina:** Similar to Hull, a Drifter's Stamina can be increased with Credits at a ratio of 4 Credits to 1 Stamina.

**Cohesion:** Credits can be traded for Cohesion at a ratio of 1 Credit to 1 Cohesion.

**Downtime:** Some downtime actions will describe ways in which Credits can be used to gain greater benefits than its base reward. Those downtime actions will list the Credit costs and their effects.
