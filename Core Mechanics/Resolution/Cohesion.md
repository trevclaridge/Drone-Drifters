# Cohesion

Cohesion is a resource that Drifters can spend to gain the upper hand in battles and other tricky situations.

Cohesion can be used to:

- reroll a Drift Die
- gain advantage on a Task roll
- give advantage to another Drifter on a Task roll
- clear a drone's system of an allocated Drift Die
- regain 1d6 Health

Drifters gain Cohesion when:

- they Assist another Drifter (1 to each Drifter involved)
- an enemy combatant is wrecked (1 to each Drifter)
- when they score a critical success in a Task roll (1 to the Drifter who made the roll and 1 to any Drifter that used Cohesion to give advantage to the Drifter who made the roll)

The GM and Drifters are also encouraged to reward each other Cohesion for especially cool or interesting roleplay. Once per session, when a Drifter (or GM) feels another Drifter has done a particularly good job in portraying their character or has created a memorable moment, they may gift that Drifter with a point of Cohesion. This gift does not take from the gifter's current Cohesion pool.

## Sidebar: Cohesion Tokens

A fun way to represent the Cohesion players can give each other is to have each player pick a token that represents their character, and pass that token when awarding Cohesion for cool roleplay. A token can be any small trinket, totem, or tchotchke; it should have some meaning to the character who awards it. When a player does something cool and one or more of the other players awards them a Cohesion, they get to look down and be reminded that their friends think they're cool.
