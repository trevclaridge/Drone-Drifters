# The Task Roll

Whenever your character attempts an action that has some chance of failure, you determine the success or failure of that action using a **task roll**. To perform a task roll, roll 2 six-sided dice and add the values together; a sum of 9 or higher is a success! Task rolls are usually *modified*, meaning you should add some value to the roll result before determining success. For example, later you will learn about Careers, which allow you to add a small bonus based on your character's background. Modifications stack, so if you get bonuses from multiple sources, you may add all of them together (along with the dice roll result) to find your final task roll value.

Some special circumstances in the narrative of the fiction may make success especially easy for your character. During these situations, your GM may allow you to roll with **advantage**. When rolling a task roll with advantage, roll with *3* dice and use the two highest values to determine success and disregard the lowest die roll result.

The opposite is also trueâ€”some scenarios may have your character working against especially difficult opposition. In those situations, you GM may impose **disadvantage**, where you again roll 3 dice, but use the two lowest values to determine result, throwing away the highest roll.

A roll of two 6s is considered a **critical success**, meaning your character goes above and beyond. Your character performs whatever action they were attempting with *style* and might get a little extra benefit as some abilities behave differently on a critical success.

A roll of two 1s is a **critical failure**, as your character trips up and fails spectacularly. *Snake eyes!*
