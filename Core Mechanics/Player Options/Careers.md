# Careers

**Careers** act as a snapshot of your character's background and skill set. *Drone Drifters* has no set list of skills; instead a character's careers indicate the knowledge and experience they can apply to the situations they will come across over the course of play.

Players will pick a set of Careers during character creation. Careers are measured in ranks starting with Rank 1 and counting upwards. Rank 1 represents a short time in the respective career and allows your character to attempt actions for which that career could feasibly provide aptitude. For example, a character with Surgeon 1 may try to perform a small surgery to remove a bullet from a friend; that same character may have trouble performing a concerto in front of a crowd if they have no rank in Performer (the GM may still allow them to try, but would likely impose a penalty).

Many mechanics throughout this rulebook will call for "rolling +Career" which indicates that you can add your Career rank to the roll total before determining success or failure, provided you have a justification for how that Career would give your character a leg up in the scenario.

**Players should choose 4 ranks worth of careers for their character before play.** You may take the same career more than once to achieve ranks of 2 or 3, but 3 is the max for character creation; advancement points awarded during play will allow for ranks higher than 3.
