# Scars

**Agoraphobic**: The vastness of space leaves you trembling. When you start a round piloting a drone that has no other combatants within 6 hexes, you roll with 2 less Drift Dice than your standard pool.

---

**Introvert**: You do your best work in the silence of being alone. When you begin a round sharing a drone with at least one other Drifter consciousnesses, roll with 2 less Drift Dice than your current standard pool.

---

**Restless**: You feel in innate need to find and feel new things. You must take the free launch at the end of your turn, and it must be to a drone of a different class than your current drone's class.

---

**Sensitive Synapses**: Your connection with your drone runs deep—maybe too deep. When the drone you are piloting takes Energy damage, half of the damage that is not blocked by Shields is applied directly to you (rounded up).

---

**Claustrophobic**: You need room to truly unleash your piloting skills. When you start a round piloting a drone that is within 6 hexes of another combatant, you roll with 2 less Drift dice than your standard pool.

---

**Overindulgent**: You get carried away, you can't help yourself. When you piloting a drone that deals the damage that wrecks a combatant, roll a d6. If the value is a 1 or a 2, the wreck is destroyed and does not yield any Credits when the battle is finished.

---

**Blood Lust**: You have a deep love and need for destruction. If you end your turn without having done at least 1 point of damage (of any type), you roll with 2 less Drift Dice than your current standard pool in the next round.

---

**Black Sheep**: You just don't quite fit in with the rest of the crew. You do not gain a Cohesion when you Assist another Drifter.

---

**Sullen**: You can't bring yourself to enjoy this thing we call war. When a Cohesion is being awarded for an enemy combatant being wrecked, roll a d6. If the value is a 1 or a 2, you do not get the Cohesion.

---

**Squeamish**: The thrill of battle is a foreign concept to you. If a combatant is wrecked within 6 hexes of the drone you are piloting, you roll with 2 less Drift Dice than your current standard pool in the next round.
