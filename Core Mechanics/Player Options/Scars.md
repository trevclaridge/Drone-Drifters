# Scars

**Agoraphobic**: The vastness of space leaves you trembling. When you start a round piloting a drone that has no other combatants within 6 hexes, you roll with 2 less Drift dice than your standard pool.

---

**Introvert**: You do your best work in the silence of being alone. When you begin a round sharing a drone with at least one other Drifter consciousnesses, roll with 2 less Drift dice than your current standard pool.

---

**Restless**: You feel in innate need to find and feel new things. You must take the free launch at the end of your turn, and it must be to a drone of a different class than your current drone's class.

---

**Sensitive Synapses**: Your connection with your drone runs deepâ€”maybe too deep. When the drone you are piloting takes Energy damage, half of the damage that is not blocked by Shields is applied directly to you (rounded up).
