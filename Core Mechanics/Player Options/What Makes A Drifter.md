## Stamina

Stamina represents a Drifter's ability to maintain the intense mental energy required reach out and synchronize their minds with a machine.

When a Drifter reaches 0 Stamina, they fall unconscious from the strain. While a Drifter is unconscious, at the beginning of each new round, they can choose one of these three options:

1. Remain unconscious, waking with 1 Stamina at the end of the battle.
2. Regain Stamina by spending points of Cohesion (1 Stamina for 1 Cohesion).
3. Regain all lost Stamina and suffer a new Scar.

A Drifter may only have 3 Scars. A Drifter with 3 Scars that drops to 0 Stamina and falls unconscious replaces the 3rd option with the following:

3. Go out in a blaze of glory. Single-handedly defeat any remaining enemy combatants, then leave the story.
