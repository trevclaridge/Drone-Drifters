**Bulky Mind**: Your consciousness is especially heavy and can bounce multiple Drifter consciousnesses at the same time. When you launch into a drone containing more than one Drifted  mind, all of those minds may bounce to a new drone.

---

**Einstein**: You laugh in the face of physicists everywhere in the galaxy. You may change the damage type of weapons systems installed in the drone you are piloting. While you are piloting a drone, you may choose whether its weapons deal Ballistic or Energy damage; your choice remains true for other Drifted consciousnesses that may be sharing the drone with you.

---

**Evasive Flyer**: You can thread the needle between rocket barrages. When a drone you are piloting takes Ballistic damage, roll a d6. On a roll of 4+, divide the incoming damage by 2, rounding up, then reduce with Armor as normal before applying any remainder.

---

**L.A.S.E.R Specialist**: During battle, you are able to tune a drone's Energy attacks to the proper wavelengths to cut past standard defenses. Attacks you roll that deal Energy damage ignore Shields.

---

**Multitasker**: You can split your mind into two distinct consciousness when Drifting. During combat, you may split your mind to control two consciousnesses that can launch independently of each other. Additionally, instead of rolling your standard pool of Drift dice at the beginning of each round, when your mind is split you instead roll two sets of Drift dice, each with 1 less die and of 1 die tier lower than your standard pool (for example, if your standard pool is 4d6, your dice pools are split into 2 pools of 3d4). Each set represents the capability of one drifted consciousness and are assigned to Drift abilities separately; the two consciousness from a split mind may only Assist each other if they share a drone, as normal.

---

**Patient** - You take your time, but you also never stop building **momentum**. At the start of combat, roll a d12—the result is your starting momentum. Whenever you make an attack, you may add your current momentum value to the damage. Every time you move a drone, you gain 1 momentum. The maximum momentum you can have is 12—if you add 12 damage from momentum to a single attack, reroll your momentum die to get a new starting momentum value.

---

**Speed Daemon**: Your mind has an infectious sense of hurry. You may move or maneuver a sum of 5 additional hexes or hex faces than the drone you are currently piloting's Speed value.

---

**Tactician**: You are adept at understanding and directing the flow of battle. You may Assist another drifter without needing to share a drone with them.
