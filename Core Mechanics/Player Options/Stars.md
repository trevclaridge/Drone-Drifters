# Stars

**Bulky Mind**: Your consciousness is especially heavy and can bounce multiple Drifter consciousnesses at the same time. When you launch into a drone containing more than one Drifted  mind, all of those minds may bounce to a new drone.

---

**Einstein**: You laugh in the face of physicists everywhere in the galaxy. You may change the damage type of weapons systems installed in the drone you are piloting. While you are piloting a drone, you may choose whether its weapons deal Ballistic or Energy damage; your choice remains true for other Drifted consciousnesses that may be sharing the drone with you.

---

**Evasive Flyer**: You can thread the needle between rocket barrages. When a drone you are piloting takes Ballistic damage, roll a d6. On a roll of 4+, divide the incoming damage by 2, rounding up, then reduce with Armor as normal before applying any remainder.

---

**L.A.S.E.R Specialist**: During battle, you are able to tune a drone's Energy attacks to the proper wavelengths to cut past standard defenses. Attacks you roll that deal Energy damage ignore Shields.

---

**Multitasker**: You can split your mind into two distinct consciousness when Drifting. During combat, you may split your mind to control two consciousnesses that can launch independently of each other. Additionally, instead of rolling your standard pool of Drift dice at the beginning of each round, when your mind is split you instead roll two sets of Drift dice, each with 1 less die and of 1 die tier lower than your standard pool (for example, if your standard pool is 4d6, your dice pools are split into 2 pools of 3d4). Each set represents the capability of one drifted consciousness and are assigned to Drift abilities separately; the two consciousness from a split mind may only Assist each other if they share a drone, as normal.

---

**Patient** - You take your time, but you also never stop building **momentum**. At the start of combat, roll a d12—the result is your starting momentum. Whenever you make an attack, you may add your current momentum value to the damage. Every time you move a drone, you gain 1 momentum. The maximum momentum you can have is 12—if you add 12 damage from momentum to a single attack, reroll your momentum die to get a new starting momentum value.

---

**Speed Daemon**: Your mind has an infectious sense of hurry. You may move or maneuver a sum of 5 additional hexes or hex faces than the drone you are currently piloting's Speed value.

---

**Tactician**: You are adept at understanding and directing the flow of battle. You may Assist another drifter without needing to share a drone with them.

---

**Clean Freak**: Please put your shoes on the rack. When you Drift into a new drone, you may immediately Clear a Drift Die from one of its systems without needing to spend a Cohesion.

---

**Favorite Child**: You have a special kinship with a specific drone from the fleet. Pick a drone from your fleet and note it down. When you are piloting this drone, you may cut the activation cost of its systems by half (rounded up). This reduction in cost applies to you and any other Drifters you are sharing the drone with.

---

**Battle Medic**: You can administer some healing aid to your fellow pilots. Once per round, when you sharing a drone with another Drifter, you can roll 2d4. The Drifter you are with regains Stamina equal to the result. You can use this Star at any time, including outside of your turn.

---

**Frenetic**: Your naturally-high energy translate into hyper vigilance in the theater of battle. Once per round, when you are piloting a drone that is being attacked by another combatant, you can perform a speedy maneuver to reduce the incoming damage. When you trigger this Star, all damage from the attack is reduced by half (rounded down). You can use this Star at any time, including outside of your turn.

---

**Natty:** You are especially strong. Roll with advantage on Task Rolls that involve brute strength.

---

**Speechreader**: You can read lips with ease. When can you see a character speaking, but are out of earshot, you can still understand what they are saying. The GM may require a Task Roll if the situation makes reading the character's lips difficult (i.e. they are slightly obscured, they are speaking a language with which you lack familiarity, they are of a different species to you, etc.); you make any such roll with advantage.

---

**Soft Walker**: You move with a cat like grace. Roll with advantage on Task Rolls that involve moving silently or sneaking.

---

**Jack of All Trades:** You pick up talents easily. The cost of acquiring new Career ranks is reduced by half for you. If you pick this Star at Drifter creation, you start the game with 3 additional Career ranks to allocate as you wish.

---

**Servant Leader**: You're always quick to offer a helping hand. 3 times per session, you can give another Drifter advantage on a Task Roll without needing to spend a Cohesion. You still gain a Cohesion if the other Drifter ends up rolling a critical success.

---

**Workaholic**: You're definitely going to get Employee of the Month. You roll with an additional d6 to acquire Credits when taking the Work downtime action.

---

**Grease Monkey**: You are a capable repair mechanic. You restore an additional d12 worth of damage when you take the Repair downtime action.

---

**Endurant**: You could totally run a 5k. You gain an additional point of Stamina when taking the Train downtime action, and your maximum Stamina increased from 10 to 20. If you pick this Star at Drifter creation, you start the game with 2 additional points of Stamina.

---

**Supportive Parent**: You very proud of your hard-working chilluns. You can award 2 Cohesion for good roleplay each session instead of 1.
