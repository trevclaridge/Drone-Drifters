# Drone Drifters

Humanity: a refugee race. With Earth destroyed, we divide ourselves and flee to the utmost corners of our perceived reality. We swim through void, crowded on arks of old design. We seek our next Home.
We expect many dangers along the way. This is why we need you.

You are a Drifter. For most, space battle is a chaos to be feared; we huddle in the dark corridors and listen to clangs and groans of strained metal. For a Drifter, the chaos is of another level, as you ricochet you consciousness among our few remaining attack drones. Firing here, maneuvering there, yours is a theater of hurtling perspective shifts. A war fought remotely, damage done Elsewhere, but the pain remains all too local, its lasting effects all too real.

We understand you feel this pain, but we need you to grit it. We will not survive without you.
