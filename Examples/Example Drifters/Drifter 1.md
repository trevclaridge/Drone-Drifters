## Stars

- **Multitasker**: You can split your mind into two distinct consciousness when Drifting. During combat, you may split your mind to control two consciousnesses that can launch independently of each other. Additionally, instead of rolling your standard pool of Drift dice at the beginning of each round, when your mind is split you instead roll two sets of Drift dice, each with 1 less die than your standard pool. Each set represents the capability of one drifted consciousness and are assigned to Drift abilities separately; the two consciousness from a split mind may only Assist each other if they share a drone, as normal.

- **Bulky Mind**: Your consciousness is especially heavy and can bounce multiple Drifter consciousnesses at the same time. When you launch into a drone containing more than one Drifted  mind, all of those minds may bounce to a new drone.

## Scars

- **Agoraphobic**: The vastness of space leaves you trembling. When you start a round piloting a drone that has no other combatants within 6 hexes, you roll with 2 less Drift dice than your standard pool.
