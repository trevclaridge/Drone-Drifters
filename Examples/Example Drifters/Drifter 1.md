# Example Drifter 1

## Stars

- **Multitasker**: You can split your mind into two distinct consciousness when Drifting. During combat, you may split your mind to control two tokens that can Launch independently of each other. Additionally, instead of rolling the standard 4 Drift dice at the beginning of each round, when your mind is split you instead roll two sets of 3 Drift dice, one set for each token.

- **Bulky Mind**: Your consciousness is especially heavy and can bounce multiple Drifter consciousnesses at the same time. When you launch into a drone containing more than one Drifted  mind, all of those minds may bounce to a new drone.

## Scars

- **Introvert**: You do your best work in the silence of being alone. When you begin a round sharing a drone with at least one other Drifter consciousnesses, roll with 2 less Drifter dice than your current standard pool.
