## Stars

- **Einstein**: You laugh in the face of physicists everywhere in the galaxy. You may change the damage type of weapons systems installed in the drone you are piloting. While you are piloting a drone, you may choose whether its weapons deal Ballistic or Energy damage; your choice remains true for other Drifted consciousnesses that may be sharing the drone with you.

- **Speed Daemon**: Your mind has an infectious sense of hurry. You may move or maneuver a sum of 5 additional hexes or hex faces than the drone you are currently piloting's Speed value.

## Scars

- **Restless**: You feel in innate need to find and feel new things. You must take the free launch at the end of your turn, and it must be to a drone of a different class than your current drone's class.
