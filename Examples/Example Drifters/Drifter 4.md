# Example Drifter 4

## Stars

- **Patient** - You take your time, but you also never stop building **momentum**. At the start of combat, roll a d12, the result of die is your starting momentum. Whenever you make an attack, you may add your current momentum value to the damage. Every time you move a drone, you gain 1 momentum. The max momentum you can have is 12--if you add 12 damage from momentum to a single attack, reroll your momentum die to get a new starting momentum value.

- **Steady** - Your mind is not so easily moved. When another Drifter launches into the drone you are currently inhabitting, you may choose to not bounce to a new drone.
