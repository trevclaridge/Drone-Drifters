## Launch (Cost: 1)

## Stars

- **Patient** - You take your time, but you also never stop building **momentum**. At the start of combat, roll a d12, the die is your starting momentum. Whenever you make an attack, you may add your current momentum value to the damage. Every time you move a drone, you gain 1 momentum. The maximum momentum you can have is 12—if you add 12 damage from momentum to a single attack, reroll your momentum die to get a new starting momentum value.

- **Tactician**: You are adept at understanding and directing the flow of battle. You may Assist another drifter without needing to share a drone with them.

## Scars

- **Sensitive Synapses**: Your connection with your drone runs deep—maybe too deep. When the drone you are piloting takes Energy damage, half of the damage that is not blocked by Shields is applied directly to you (rounded up).
