# Example Drifter 4

## Stars

- **Patient** - You take your time, but you also never stop building **momentum**. At the start of combat, place a d12 off to the side with the 1 face facing up; this die will be used to track your momentum. Every time you move a drone, you gain 1 momentum and increase the momentum die by 1. Whenever you make an attack, you may add your current momentum value to the damage. The max momentum you can have is 12.

- **Steady** - Your mind is not so easily moved. When another Drifter launches into the drone you are currently inhabitting, you may choose to not bounce to a new drone.
