# Example Drifter 2

## Stars

- **L.A.S.E.R Specialist**: During battle, you are able to tune drones' Energy attacks to the proper wavelengths to cut past standard defenses. Attacks you roll that deal Energy damage ignore Shields.

- **Evasive Flyer**: You can thread the needle between rocket barrages. When a drone you are inhabiting takes Ballistic damage, roll a d6. On a roll of 4+, divide the incoming damage by 2, rounding up, then reduce with Armor as normal before applying any remainder.
